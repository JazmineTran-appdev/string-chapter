# Should output:
# 
# "Add it together"
# 
# using at least one String addition character.
# Use at least two variables to store the parts 
# of the string before you add them together.
# 
# (Don't just print the String literal `"Add it together"`)

first_part = "Add"

second_part = " it together"

p first_part + second_part

# ~~~~~ Specs ~~~~~
#
# addition.rb should output 'Add it together' using String addition
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### SOLUTION:

# first_part = "Add"
# second_part = " it together"
# puts first_part + second_part
